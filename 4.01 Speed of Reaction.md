# Catalysts
- Catalysts lower the activation energy of a chemical reaction by providing an alternative route for the reaction
- The decompression of hydrogen peroxide in an exothermic reaction

-   More frequent effective collisions take pace between reactant particles, speeding up the chemical process
-   Catalyst Characteristics 
    -   Reduces the activation energy of a chemical reaction
    - Changes/Speeds up the chemical reaction
    - Needed in small amounts
    - Not used up in the reaction
    - Reduce costs
    -   Improve energy efficiency and use less energy per unit time, this in turn, saves costs
    -   Ensures reaction occurs more efficiently at a shorter duration of time
    -   Regenerated and do no need to be substituted. No additional costs incurred to purchase chemicals
-   Examples of uses of Enzymes:
    
    -   Enzymes in Yeast to make soy sauce
    -   Enzymes in papaya is used to make meat tenderiser
    -   Enzymes that break down fats and proteins are used in washing powders

# Rate of Reaction Graphs

1.  Gradient of Graph
    -   Steep → Fast
        
    -   Gentle → Slow
        
    -   Rate of Reaction
        
        Factors
        
        -   Pressure → Gaseous
        -   Particle Size/S.A. to reactant ratio
        -   Concentration of solution
        -   Temperature
        -   Catalyst
2.  Yield of reaction:
    -   No. of moles of limiting reagent
        -   Solid → mass of CaCO3
        -   Aqueous → concentration and vol
        -   Gas → Number of Particles
