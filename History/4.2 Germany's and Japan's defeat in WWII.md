# *UNSORTED NOTES*

# Reasons for the defeat of Germany
- USA's entry into WWII
- Over extension of Hitler's army on many fronts
# Reasons for the defeat of Japan
- Allied victory in Europe
- Economic and military might of USA
- Over-extension of Japanese empire
# WWII - Second World War
- Involved almost every part of the world from 1939-1945
- Axis Powers - Germany, Italy, Japan
- Allies - France, Britain, USA, USSR
- Est. 40-50 million deaths
- Largest war in history to date

## Europe: Reasons for German success
### Germany
- Started preparation for war when Hitler came to power
- Wehrmacht was much more equpped with superior firepower
- Luftwaffe was best of its kind in 1939
- Blitzkrieg (lightning war) used to devastating effect
### Britain France & Allies
- Due to the Great Depression, did not start rearming till late 1930s
- Obsolete WWI equipment, e.g. France 131/634 planes and nearly all 400+ bombers were obsolete
## Blitzkrieg
Stages:
1. Dive bombers attack key targets, eg. roads, railway stations, air fields to destroy enemy communications
2. Tanks and motorised artillery punch holes in enemy line, isolate segments of enemy; surrounded and captured by infantry divisions
3. Large number of troops move in, travelling as fast as possible

## Asia-Pacific: Reasons for Japanese Success
- WWII in Europe - Britain and France were to busy fighting Germany to defend their colonies in Asia
- All available resources were redeployed
- Japanese troops were battle-hardened (fighting since 1937 Sino-Japanese War) v.s. Inexperienced Allied troops (Britain soldiers had never fought in jungles)
- Both Britain and France underestimated the Japanese military's capabilities and use of blitzkrieg
## Brutalities during WWII
### Germans
- Attempted Racial Annihilation of Jews, Russians
- Other victims often included gypsies, patients with disabilities
- Extreme cruelty to Soviet POW
### Japanese
- Kempetai - use of torture, mass executions to instil fear among locals
- Notable Crimes included:
	- Sandakan death marches
	- Forcing women of occupied territories to serve as sex workers
	- Death Railway
	- Biological and Chemical Testing on POW and Civilians
## Early Axis Successes
- In early 1842, Germany and Japan looked invincible with much of Europe and Asia occupied by the Axis Powers
- Britain and the USSR barely survived onslaughts while USA was just getting started
- However the tide turned by late 1942 as both Germany and Japan started experiencing setbacks
- By April 1945 Hitler committed suicide; Germany surrendered in May
- Japan announced its surrender in August and officially did so in September 1945
- Why were Germany and Japan defeated

## (i) How did the USA's involvement contribute to the defeat of Germany in WWII?
### Pre-Pearl Harbour *(p. 139-143)*
- USA was in isolation since the end of WWI
- 1937 Neutrality Act

- 1939: **'Cash & Carry'** (sold arms while maintaining neutrality)
- March 1941: With France defeated and Britain financially crippled, USA introduced **Lend-Lease Act**
- Roosevelt's speech on the USA as an 'arsenal of democracy, justfying increase of aid'
- Imposed **military and economic sanctions** on Axis Powers
- Expanded size of army and navy; utilised navy to **provide escort** for Allied convoys

#### Cash and Carry vs Lend-Lease Act
**Cash and Carry**
- Sept 1939 - Revised Neutrality Act
- Maintain neutrality while providing military aids to Britain and France
- Allies needed to biy goods, pay in full and transport on their own limitations:
	- Britain - bankrupt end 1940
	- France - fell in June 1940
	- German U-boats sunk supply ships crossing the Atlantic
**Lend-Lease Act**
- March 1941 - To protect US interests, the President is allowed to supply weapons, food and equipment to any countries whose defence was vital e.g. Britain, USSR
- Payment could be deferred
- USA provided transportation of supplied
- Spent almost US$50 Billion
- Effectiveness: Keep Allies afloat during the war

## (ii) How did Germany contribute to their own downfall?
### What was the Battle of Britain, June 1940
- Hitler was hoping that Britain would step down from war after the fall of France
- However, Churchill made it clear that he would fight Germany to the finish
- Hitler hoped to gain control of the air over southern England before crossing the English Channel
- Original German plan was to attack RAF - bomb shipping and coastal defences; airfields & radar installation

**RAF Strengths**|**Luftwaffe Weaknesses**
-------------|--------------------
RAF led by Sir Hugh Dowding - planned British air defence since 1936. Brough in technical developments, eg. bullet-proof windscreens for fighter planes; command and communication systems|Hermann Goering was not good at tactics - shifted focus of attackers, causing confusion; did not implement radars
Invested in Radars, able to detect enemy planes before they arrived|Wrong type of aircrafts - Stuka dive bombers were geared to supporting army by bombing, not dog fights
Fighter planes such as Spitfire and Hurricanes were faster than German planes|German fighters only had enough fuel to fly for 30 minutes over England; did not build long-range aircrafts
RAF pilots who bailed out over Britain could return to duty|German pilots who bailed out over Britain became prisoners
### What mistake(s) did Hitler make?
- German lost 1733 planes vs 915 for RAF (July-Oct)
- On the verge of success, Hitler interfered and changed strategies
- Many German bombs fell on British cities in 1940-41 (35k tons) during the Blitz
- But the Luftwaffe did not succeed in destroying the RAF
- RAF given more breathing space to repair airfield and radar systems
- Fear of attack from the air stopped Hitler from committing his invasion force
### What was Operation Barbarossa
- Hitler turned his attention to the USSR after his failed attempt to conquer Britain
- He had always been interested in gaining lands in the east
- He decided to launch his attack on the USSR in the spring of 1941 (Operation Barbarossa)
- However, before he could carry out his planned invasion of who was having difficulties in the Balkans (south-east Europe) and North Africa
- Within 3 months, German blitzkrieg nearly destroyed the entire air and tank forces, killing 4 million soviet soldiers
### War on 2 Fronts
#### How did Hitler's mistakes contribute to the defeat of Germany
1. Operation Barbarossa lead to the USSR entereing WWII on the side of the Allies; Hitler brought about a two-front war which backfired eventually as Germany took on more territories than their forces could cope with
2. Assisting Italy meant a delay in the invasion of the USSR, which gave the latter an opportunity to survive the onslaught
3. Before conquering the USSR, Hitler declared war on the USA, thinking the latter would be preoccupied with Japan; USA contributed greatly to the defeat of Germany
4. Had no Plan B when blitzkrieg did not work and interfered with military strategies repeatedly, leading to the German's eventual defeat on the Eastern Font
